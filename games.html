			<p> "Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" is one of the recent additions to the Legend of Zelda franchise. Released in 2023 as a sequel to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it's an RPG Sandbox Open World game that blends progression and open world adventuring together in a really nice way. The gameplay focuses on using items that Link, the player's character, obtains and the abilities he gets from certain ingame structures. That along with the storyline about saving princess Zelda from Ganondorf makes it a really nice game to play for relaxation. </p>

			<h3> 5 reasons why this game is my favorite </h3>
			<ul> 
				<li> The open world aspect of the game, along with various ways of traversing the terrain allow for an immersive experience. </li>
				<li> Sheer possibility. The amount of possible solutions to the many challenges in the game is pretty insane. </li>
				<li> Messing around is neccessary. Unless you're a tryhard with a hatred of having fun, the amount of borderline goofy things you can do in the game will never stop amusing you. </li>
				<li> Playstyles. Due to it being a sandbox game, you can choose and try out many different types of playstyles. You can discover every inch of the sky, land, and even underground. However, if that doesn't suit you, you can speedrun the game by using all glitches and exploits you have at hand. </li>
				<li> Quests. There are a lot of them, they more than DOUBLE the content of the game, and that's considering the fact that the main game itself is already huge. </li>
			</ul>
